# AICC Solutions

Code solutions for the [AI Community Contest](https://ioai-community-contest.netlify.app/).

This competition is organized by the **IOAI Community Contest** group (not affiliated with IOAI), which is made up of IOAI alumni. It is meant to prepare students for the **IOAI** (International Olympiad in Artificial Intelligence). 

We will continue working to provide more written explanations, besides the code notebooks. We are also students and this takes time. Stay tuned!

We are open to Pull Requests for more explanations and editorials. Currently, there are code solutions for all 9 tasks.
